Task 2: REST API Client - Weather Data Fetcher Application**

This Java application serves as a REST API client that consumes weather data from a public API and presents it in a structured, user-friendly format. The program demonstrates core concepts of web service consumption, HTTP request handling, JSON response parsing, and data presentation - all essential skills for modern Java developers working with web services and APIs.

**Technical Implementation:**
The application utilizes Java's built-in `HttpURLConnection` class to establish HTTP connections with the Open-Meteo weather API, a free public service that provides comprehensive meteorological data without requiring API key authentication. The implementation follows RESTful principles by making a GET request to the API endpoint configured with specific parameters for London's geographical coordinates (latitude: 51.5074, longitude: -0.1278).
